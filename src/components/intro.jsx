        This page is my personal timeline—every square you see below stands for
        one week of my life since October 30, 2001. The green squares show the
        weeks I’ve already lived; the gray ones represent the future that’s
        still open to me. Key milestones—moments that shaped my journey—are
        highlighted for quick reflection. It’s a simple way to zoom out, see how
        far I’ve come, and remind myself just how many stories, memories, and
        opportunities fit into a lifetime. <br />
        <b>
          On touchscreens, press and hold the highlighted squares to see more
          details about those milestones.
